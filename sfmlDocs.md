# file I/O
  Beautiful tool for jsons:
    https://github.com/nlohmann/json
  `brew tap nlohmann/json`
  `brew install nlohmann-json`

# rendering 
  view: center
  viewPort: topleft corner
  sprites: top left corner
  text: top left corner

-- moral of the story: views are the only thing that need a center
